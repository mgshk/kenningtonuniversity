At University of Kennington, we understand you shouldn''t have to sacrifice these things in order to earn your degree.\r\n\r\n<strong>Online Classes</strong>\r\n\r\nAlong with our convenient night classes, University of Kennington also offers the ease of online classes to its students. Some students pursue their degree at one of our residential campuses while others pursue their degree online. Some students choose a combination of both (online and at the campus). Online courses are taught by professors that meet the same credentialing and qualifications as required for traditional courses. Online students regularly interact with their instructor and classmates in an online system that is intuitive to use.\r\n\r\nWe have designed our online courses with the same learning objectives you find in our traditional classroom-based courses. The only difference is that by taking an online course, you get to choose when to come in, when to leave, and at what pace you learn.\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-191" src="http://kenningtonuniversity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/beautiful-girl-student-smie-pose-with-books-stand-in-park-college-students.jpg" alt="beautiful-girl-student-smie-pose-with-books-stand-in-park-college-students" width="600" height="250" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Flexible Scheduling with Face-to-Face Classes</strong>\r\n\r\nUniversity of Kennington is proud to offer returning students the flexible scheduling that allows them to pursue both their career and their degree.
